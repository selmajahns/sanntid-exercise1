Exercise 1 - Theory questions
-----------------------------

### Concepts

What is the difference between *concurrency* and *parallelism*?
> Parallelism is when to things is done at the same time. While concurrency can do multiple thing at the same time too, it does not need to be the exact same actions or exactly at the same time.

What is the difference between a *race condition* and a *data race*? 
> A data race is when an object is written to and accessed by an other thread, both at the same time. Race condtions is when events og actions order changes the outcome.
 
*Very* roughly - what does a *scheduler* do, and how does it do it?

### Engineering

Why would we use multiple threads? What kinds of problems do threads solve?
> *Your answer here*

Some languages support "fibers" (sometimes called "green threads") or "coroutines"? What are they, and why would we rather use them over threads?
> *Your answer here*

Does creating concurrent programs make the programmer's life easier? Harder? Maybe both?
> *Your answer here*

What do you think is best - *shared variables* or *message passing*?
